    "# Session 2a: Image processing using Python\n",
    "*IMPRS - Using Python for Cognitive Science (2022). This tutorial is made by Noor Seijdel and is partly based on work by [Lukas Snoek](https://lukas-snoek.com/) and [Sophie Slaats](https://www.mpi.nl/people/slaats-sophie), and on the [Pillow tutorial](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/tutorial.html).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! In this week you will learn how to use Python for image processing. In the past weeks you have become familiar with basic Python syntax and constructs and some Python packages. In this week, we will discuss digital image processing using Jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "After this session you will know:\n",
    "- What a Jupyter notebook is, and how you can use one\n",
    "- How to open and save image files\n",
    "- How to resize, crop, copy, move, rotate or overlay images\n",
    "- How to convert an image to a different file format \n",
    "\n",
    "Doing these things will help to improve your Python skills and will demonstrate how to prepare images for your experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Before we begin.. what is a Jupyter notebook?\n",
    "As you can see, you are currently looking at a file with a \".ipynb\" extension, instead of the \".py\" files we worked with in the previous weeks. This means you're looking at a Jupyter notebook file. Jupyter notebooks (previously called \"IPython Notebooks, hence \"ipynb\") are a kind of editor from which you can run Python code. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.1 Code cells \n",
    "The nice thing about these notebooks is that you can mix text cells (such as the one you are reading now) with code cells. Similar to code sections in R (indicated using  \"#\") or in MATLAB (using \"%%\") using code cells allows you to run only a part of your code. Let's look at a code cell:\n",

    "\n",
    "##### 2.1 What is an image?\n",
    "An image, digital image, or still image is a binary representation of visual information, such as drawings, pictures, graphs, logos, or individual video frames. An image is composed of picture elements, also known as pixels, each with a value for its intensity or gray-level. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways a digital image can be encoded: \n",
    "- Bitmap images (.jpeg, .gif, ,.png)\n",
    "- Vector images (.svg, .eps, .ai)\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will focus on Bitmap images. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.2 Bitmap images\n",
    "Bitmap images (also known as raster images) are made up of pixels in a grid. Pixels are picture elements; tiny dots of individual colour that make up what you see on your screen. Pixels are defined by 2 properties: their *position* on the picture/grid and their *colour value*. These properties are stored in a bitmap file for every single pixel in the picture. This means that images are actually arrays (do you remember arrays?) of binary numbers. The more bits (the longer the binary number), the more colours that can be encoded.\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "##### 2.3 Image processing libraries - Pillow\n",
    "If you are doing your image processing with Python, there are various libraries you could use. Some popular ones are OpenCV, scikit-image, Python Imaging Library and Pillow. We won't discuss which image processing library is the best here; they all have their merits. This module will focus on Pillow, a powerful library that provides a wide array of image processing features and is simple to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pillow is a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL). PIL is a library that offers several standard procedures for manipulating images. It's a powerful library but hasn't been updated since 2009 and doesn't support Python 3. Pillow builds on this, adding more features and support for Python 3. It supports a range of image file formats such as PNG, JPEG, PPM, GIF, TIFF, and BMP. We'll see how to perform various operations on images such as cropping, resizing, adding text to images, rotating, greyscaling, etc., using this library.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.4 Locating the images \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can work with and edit images, the system needs to know where we've stored them. If you have correctly forked and cloned this week's repository, you should have a folder with images located in your repository. You can use those images for the exercises. However, if you want to play around with your own images, feel free to use those!  "
